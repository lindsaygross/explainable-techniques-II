        "\n",
        "- **Sleep Duration**: The effect increases as sleep goes up. Around 7.5–8 hours, the jump is especially strong, meaning the model predicts longer sleep has a clear positive influence.  \n",
        "- **Stress Level**: The plot shows a drop after stress levels of about 5–6, which reinforces the finding that high stress hurts the prediction. Lower stress levels stay more stable.  \n",

        "The main difference is that PDP can sometimes exaggerate the relationship if features are correlated, because it averages over all instances without accounting for feature dependencies. ALE looks at local effects within intervals of the feature, which makes it less biased. For example, in the **Stress Level** plots, PDP suggested a sharp drop, but ALE smoothed this out and showed a more gradual decline, which is likely a more realistic effect.  \n",
